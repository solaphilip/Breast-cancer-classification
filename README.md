# Breast-cancer-classification
This project focuses on breast cancer classification using machine learning. Five algorithms were tested to find the most accurate model for predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant. It includes data preprocessing, model comparison, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall, identifying the best model for classification.
